# About
Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Times New Roman and using colors inspired by the default color scheme(this is ideal for a color printout or rendering on any compatible devices).If you are looking for a simple printable CV, check out [this template](https://github.com/ssharad/simple-two-column-resume-in-latex) 

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Times New Roman (I think you this'll work with Latex2e also), biblatex to print my publications and textpos for the aside.
